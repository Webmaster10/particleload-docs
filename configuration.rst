Configuration
=======================

Accessing the Configurator
===============================
To access the settings page, go to https://<yourdomain.tld>/<particleloadfolder>/settings.php

For example, if your domain name is "myamazingdomain.com" and the folder you put ParticleLoad in is called "loadingscreen", go to http://myamazingdomain.com/loadingscreen/settings.php

You will be presented with a Steam login page, sign in with your Steam account to continue.

.. note::
    Only the Steam account defined in config.php next to $admin will be able to log in here. By default this is the account that purchased ParticleLoad on ScriptFodder.
