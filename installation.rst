Installation
======================

Extract ParticleLoad
----------------------------------
After you have downloaded ParticleLoad, extract the "INSTALL" folder from the ParticleLoad zip file to somewhere on your computer, preferably your desktop for easy access.

Getting Your Steam API Key
----------------------------------------
Before installing ParticleLoad, you will need to head over `here <https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey>`_ to get your Steam API key. If you have not already filled in this form, do so now to get your Steam API Key.

Entering Your Steam API Key
-----------------------------------
Now, open up the "INSTALL" folder you previously extracted, and edit the file called "config.php". Where you see the line: ::

    $steamAPIKey = "";

Enter your Steam API Key between the two quotation marks and save your changes.
