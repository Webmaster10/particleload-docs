Updating
==============

Updating ParticleLoad is the same no matter what version you are on or what the latest version is. Simply extract the files from inside the "UPDATE" folder of the newest version of ParticleLoad, then upload them into the folder on your web host you installed ParticleLoad in, overwriting the old files.
